Introduction
============

Gretel is a Ruby on Rails plugin that makes it easy yet flexible to create breadcrumbs.
It emphasizes that breadcrumbs should is a front end matter and should reside in views rather than models and controllers.


Example
=======

In config/initializers/breadcrumbs.rb:

Gretel::Crumbs.layout do
 
  crumb :root do
    link "Home", root_path
  end
 
  crumb :projects do
    link "Projects", projects_path
  end
 
  crumb :project do |project|
    link project.name, project_path(project)
    parent :projects
  end
 
  crumb :project_issues do |project|
    link "Issues", project_issues_path(project)
    parent :project, project
  end
 
  crumb :issue do |issue|
    link issue.name, issue_path(issue)
    parent :project_issues, issue.project
  end

end

In app/views/layouts/application.html.erb:

  <%= breadcrumb :pretext => "You are here:", :separator => ">", :autoroot => true, :home_alone => true, :link_last => false %>

In app/views/xx/xx.html.erb:

  <% breadcrumb :issue, @issue %>

Options for <%= breadcrumb %>:
  :pretext     Text to be rendered before breadcrumb, if any. Default: none
  :separator   Separator between links. Default: >
  :autoroot    Whether it should automatically link to :root if no root parent is given. Default: false
  :home_alone  Whether it should show "Home" if this is the only link. Default: false
  :link_last   Whether the last crumb should be linked to. Default: false
